Carter's Catering Website

James Carter decided that the best way for him to contribute to the Jackson society was for him to cook delicious foods, and thus
Carter's Catering was born. Ever since, he has been trying to find a way to expand his business. Through a mutual friend, we got
in contact with James. James provided us with many things such as pictures, a paper coppy of his menu, and all of his contact 
information for the website.

This website was created to allow James expand his business so he can get more customers.

The Website

 - Our Website is very simple to understand and navigate. Our Website is eye appealing and is not too fancy because we 
 did not want the customer to have any trouble navigating the site.
 
 - The colors of our page consists of tan and a lightish brown because they are the colors of James's logo which is also
   included in the top left of every page. Each page (except the home page) has what we call a Vertical Page Identifier to
   add a little extra zing to the site.

 - We have included two PHP files that allow the customer on the website to order food or have James cater an event. Both 
   the Order and Catering pages include a section to specify which toppings the customer does or does not want on their foods.
 
 - A few features of the site include a slide show to make the customer hungry and to show off a few of the foods that he
   serves. We've also included links to his social medias to enable the customer to be able to check out some of the responses other 
   customers have had to the food and see other pictures James has taken over the years.
 
 - The Menu page has many pictures and descriptions of all of the foods that are served and on which days they are available. James also 
   does specials every Friday so we included a specials page that includes some of the specials he will or has done and on what date they
   will or have been served. 
 
 - The home page includes a slide show of some of the foods, a Catering Button in the center of the page (to emphasize that he does cater), 
   and even real testimonies that the team hand picked from his social media sites. 

Problems We Faced and How We Fixed Them:

 1) When we first started the website the CSS would work perfectly fine but then it completely stopped working.
 
   -To fix this, we took the link of the home page and copy and pasted it into a private page in FireFox.
 
 2) One day when we came into class and logged-in to Cloud 9, my partner and I could see all of our work but we could not see 
    when the other made changes to the website.
 
   -To fix this, we had to make a new project and copy everything we had already done over to the new project. 

 3) Our slide show was not working at all and none of the pictures we attempted to use were appearing on the site.
   
   -To fix this, we had to go home and get on his social media and save the pictures to our phones and upload them to the 
    computer and then to Cloud 9 so we could put them in where we wanted to. 

 4) The footer we were going to use wasnt appearing. It only would show white space.
   
   -To fix this, we ended up taking the footer out of the website and turned it into our Contact Page so customers didnt 
    have to search for the information. Now all they need to do is click on thelink to the Contact Page.
 
 5) Our Order and Catering pages would not send an email to the specified e-mail address notifying James that he had an order
    placed on the site.
   
   -To fix this, we actually had the help of a friend who is in Coding 2 because we were not going to be taught PHP which is
    what we needed to make the e-mail go through. In doing so, we had to change our Order and Catering Pages from ".html" to 
    ".php".
